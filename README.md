Linear regression model built using Python. I worked with a dataset where I predicted a variable Y based on X (independent variable), creating a regression line to capture the relationship.
To visualize the results, I used matplotlib to generate a scatter plot of the actual data points and overlay the regression line, which allowed me to assess the fit of the model clearly.
This dataset contains information from the 1990 U.S. Census regarding housing in California. It includes 20,640 instances (rows) and 8 numeric attributes (columns) that describe the characteristics of the homes in different block groups (small geographical areas).
